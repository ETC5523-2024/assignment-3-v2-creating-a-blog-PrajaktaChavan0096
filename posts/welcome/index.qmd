### Executive Summary

This blog analyzes global food expenditure per person and the proportion of countries recording high food prices. These datasets highlight disparities in food expenditure across nations, as well as the impact of food price volatility in recent years.

### Problem Description

The fluctuation of global food prices, driven by economic and environmental factors, poses a significant challenge, particularly for lower-income nations. This analysis explores two main aspects: how much people spend on food in different countries and how high food prices have impacted countries globally.

### Data Description

We used two datasets from **Our World in Data**:

1.  **Global Food Expenditure per Person (2022)**: This dataset provides the annual expenditure on food per person across various countries.
    -   **Key Variables**:
        -   `Entity`: Country name
        -   `Total food expenditure`: Total food expenditure per person (USD)
2.  **Proportion of Countries Recording High Food Prices (2011-2021)**: This dataset tracks the percentage of countries experiencing abnormally or moderately high food prices from 2011 to 2021.
    -   **Key Variables**:
        -   `Year`: Year of observation
        -   `Proportion of countries with high food prices`: Percentage of countries recording high food prices

```{r data-loading, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load the datasets
food_expenditure <- read_csv("food-expenditure-per-person-per-year.csv")

high_food_prices <- read_csv("share-of-countries-recording-high-food-prices.csv")
```

### Data Cleaning

The datasets were cleaned to remove missing values and ensure that only complete observations were included in the analysis.

```{r data cleaning, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Clean the datasets
cleaned_food_expenditure <- food_expenditure %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Total food expenditure`))

cleaned_high_food_prices <- high_food_prices %>%
  filter(!is.na(`2.c.1 - Proportion of countries recording abnormally high or moderately high food prices, according to the Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (%) - AG_FPA_HMFP - Abnormal: High food prices`)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`2.c.1 - Proportion of countries recording abnormally high or moderately high food prices, according to the Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (%) - AG_FPA_HMFP - Moderate: Moderately high food prices`))

```

### Analysis

#### Food Expenditure per Person

The dataset on global food expenditure per person provides insights into how much people spend on food annually across different countries. The bar chart in [Figure 1](#fig-expenditure) shows the food expenditure per person for various countries in 2022.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Create a bar chart of food expenditure per person
ggplot(cleaned_food_expenditure, aes(x = reorder(Entity, `Total food expenditure`), y = `Total food expenditure`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Food Expenditure per Person by Country (2022)",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Total Food Expenditure (USD)") +
  theme_minimal()

```

[Table 1](#tbl-top10) shows the top 10 countries with the highest food expenditure per person.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Show top 10 countries with highest food expenditure
top_10_expenditure <- cleaned_food_expenditure %>%
  arrange(desc(`Total food expenditure`)) %>%
  select(Entity, `Total food expenditure`) %>%  # Select relevant columns
  head(10)

# Display the table using knitr::kable
knitr::kable(top_10_expenditure, col.names = c("Country", "Total Food Expenditure (USD)"))


```

#### Proportion of Countries with High Food Prices

The proportion of countries experiencing abnormally high or moderately high food prices increased significantly between 2011 and 2021, especially during 2020, as shown in [Figure 2](#fig-high-food-prices).

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Create a bar chart for countries recording high food prices
ggplot(cleaned_high_food_prices, aes(x = Year, 
                                     y = `2.c.1 - Proportion of countries recording abnormally high or moderately high food prices, according to the Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (%) - AG_FPA_HMFP - Abnormal: High food prices`,
                                     fill = "Abnormally High")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  geom_bar(aes(y = `2.c.1 - Proportion of countries recording abnormally high or moderately high food prices, according to the Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (%) - AG_FPA_HMFP - Moderate: Moderately high food prices`, 
               fill = "Moderately High"), stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Countries with High Food Prices (2011-2021)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Proportion of Countries (%)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Price Category", values = c("Abnormally High" = "purple", "Moderately High" = "tan"))

```

[Table 2](#tbl-high-food-2020) shows the proportion of countries with abnormally high and moderately high food prices in 2020, the year with the most significant spike in high food prices.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Ensure cleaned_high_food_prices is created correctly first
cleaned_high_food_prices <- high_food_prices %>%
  filter(!is.na(`2.c.1 - Proportion of countries recording abnormally high or moderately high food prices, according to the Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (%) - AG_FPA_HMFP - Abnormal: High food prices`)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`2.c.1 - Proportion of countries recording abnormally high or moderately high food prices, according to the Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (%) - AG_FPA_HMFP - Moderate: Moderately high food prices`))

# Now filter for the year 2020
high_food_2020 <- cleaned_high_food_prices %>%
  filter(Year == 2020)

# Select the relevant columns for the table
high_food_2020_table <- high_food_2020 %>%
  select(Year,
         `2.c.1 - Proportion of countries recording abnormally high or moderately high food prices, according to the Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (%) - AG_FPA_HMFP - Abnormal: High food prices`,
         `2.c.1 - Proportion of countries recording abnormally high or moderately high food prices, according to the Indicator of Food Price Anomalies (%) - AG_FPA_HMFP - Moderate: Moderately high food prices`)

# Display the table with appropriate column names
knitr::kable(high_food_2020_table, 
             col.names = c("Year", "Abnormally High (%)", "Moderately High (%)"))


```

### Conclusion

This analysis of global food expenditure and food price volatility reveals the economic disparities faced by countries around the world. Wealthier nations tend to have higher food expenditure per person, but their overall share of income spent on food is lower than that of lower-income countries.

In terms of food price volatility, the data shows that many countries experienced abnormally high food prices in 2020, largely due to the global pandemic's impact on supply chains and economies.

### Key Findings

Food Expenditure: Wealthier nations, such as the United States and Switzerland, spend significantly more on food per person compared to lower-income nations (see Figure 1 and Table 1). High Food Prices: 2020 saw a significant spike in countries experiencing abnormally high food prices (see Figure 2), underscoring the vulnerability of food markets during global crises.
