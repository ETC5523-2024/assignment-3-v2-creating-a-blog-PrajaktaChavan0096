This is a blog template for the **ETC5523 Communicating with Data** assessment at **Monash University**, showcasing my technical projects and skills developed through my academic journey and professional experience.

## Projects

### Virtual Air Drawing Using Gesture Detection
In this project, I implemented a virtual air drawing tool that uses machine learning algorithms to detect finger movements on camera. The application includes a color palette and uses Python with OpenCV for image processing.

### Hand Gesture Controlled Car
This project involved developing a car that can be controlled using hand gestures, utilizing convolutional neural networks and image processing to track movements and send commands to the car.

### Automated Toll Plaza System
I contributed to a project for automating toll collection using image processing. This project was part of the Texas Instruments Innovation Challenge and helped streamline the toll collection process using camera inputs.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a **Master's degree and Business Analytics** at **Monash University**, a leading global institution known for its excellence in education and research. My studies at Monash have provided me with a robust foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and business optimization techniques. Through courses like **ETC5523: Communicating with Data**, I have gained hands-on experience in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights and creating impactful data visualizations for decision-making.
Before Monash, I completed my **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science** at Cummins College of Engineering, Pune, where I developed strong programming skills and completed various projects in image processing, neural networks, and software development.
At Monash, I am honing my ability to leverage data-driven approaches to solve real-world business problems, positioning myself for impactful roles in the tech and business sectors.
