These datasets highlight disparities in food expenditure across nations, as well as the impact of food price volatility in recent years.\n\n### Problem Description\n\nThe fluctuation of global food prices, driven by economic and environmental factors, poses a significant challenge, particularly for lower-income nations. This analysis explores two main aspects: how much people spend on food in different countries and how high food prices have impacted countries globally.\n\n![Global Food Expenditure per Person](food-expenditure-per-person-per-year.png)\n\n### Data Description\n\nWe used two datasets from **Our World in Data**:\n\n1.  **Global Food Expenditure per Person (2022)**: This dataset provides the annual expenditure on food per person across various countries.\n    -   **Key Variables**:\n        -   `Entity`: Country name\n        -   `Total food expenditure`: Total food expenditure per person (USD)\n2.  **Proportion of Countries Recording High Food Prices (2011-2021)**: This dataset tracks the percentage of countries experiencing abnormally or moderately high food prices from 2011 to 2021.\n    -   **Key Variables**:\n        -   `Year`: Year of observation\n        -   `Proportion of countries with high food prices`: Percentage of countries recording high food prices\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Data Cleaning\n\nThe datasets were cleaned to remove missing values and ensure that only complete observations were included in the analysis.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Analysis\n\n#### Food Expenditure per Person\n\nThe dataset on global food expenditure per person provides insights into how much people spend on food annually across different countries. The bar chart in [Figure 1](#fig-expenditure) shows the food expenditure per person for various countries in 2022.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n[Table 1](#tbl-top10) shows the top 10 countries with the highest food expenditure per person.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Country     | Total Food Expenditure (USD)|\n|:-----------|----------------------------:|\n|Hong Kong   |                     5002.200|\n|Hong Kong   |                     4318.868|\n|Switzerland |                     4313.358|\n|Israel      |                     4245.512|\n|Hong Kong   |                     4181.517|\n|Switzerland |                     4109.086|\n|Norway      |                     4093.419|\n|Israel      |                     3996.604|\n|Switzerland |                     3970.205|\n|Switzerland |                     3908.800|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Proportion of Countries with High Food Prices\n\nThe proportion of countries experiencing abnormally high or moderately high food prices increased significantly between 2011 and 2021, especially during 2020, as shown in [Figure 2](#fig-high-food-prices).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n[Table 2](#tbl-high-food-2020) shows the proportion of countries with abnormally high and moderately high food prices in 2020, the year with the most significant spike in high food prices.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n| Year| Abnormally High (%)| Moderately High (%)|\n|----:|-------------------:|-------------------:|\n| 2020|                50.0|                16.7|\n| 2020|                13.3|                20.0|\n| 2020|                26.2|                31.0|\n| 2020|                26.7|                28.9|\n| 2020|                13.2|                36.8|\n| 2020|                 9.8|                19.5|\n| 2020|                 0.0|                 0.0|\n| 2020|                33.3|                 0.0|\n| 2020|                28.6|                21.4|\n| 2020|                15.4|                30.8|\n| 2020|                 9.1|                29.5|\n| 2020|                20.4|                27.7|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis analysis of global food expenditure and food price volatility reveals the economic disparities faced by countries around the world. Wealthier nations tend to have higher food expenditure per person, but their overall share of income spent on food is lower than that of lower-income countries.\n\nIn terms of food price volatility, the data shows that many countries experienced abnormally high food prices in 2020, largely due to the global pandemic's impact on supply chains and economies.\n\n### Key Findings\n\nFood Expenditure: Wealthier nations, such as the United States and Switzerland, spend significantly more on food per person compared to lower-income nations (see Figure 1 and Table 1). High Food Prices: 2020 saw a significant spike in countries experiencing abnormally high food prices (see Figure 2), underscoring the vulnerability of food markets during global crises.\n\n### References\n\nOur World in Data.
